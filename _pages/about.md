I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the Graduate School of Economics at the [University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/index.html), Japan. 

My research interests lie in **Econometrics** and **Bayesian Statistics**. I am particularly interested in developing efficient MCMC algorithms for state-space models and stochastic volatility models. I am currently supervised by Professor [Yasuhiro Omori](http://www.sites.google.com/site/yasuhiroomori/).

You can find my CV [here](files/cv.pdf).
